# Kenya-Resilience-Data-Hub-Team-18-Climate-Champs

The Kenya Climate Resilience Data Hub is a web-based decision-support tool designed to empower Kenyan frontline decision-makers, policymakers, and community leaders with real-time, actionable environmental insights.

This platform directly addresses the Triple Planetary Crisis — Climate Change, Biodiversity Loss, and Pollution & Waste — by integrating data from public and institutional sources into an interactive, location-based interface.

Through predictive analytics, data visualizations, and risk alerts, the dashboard enables users to:

* Monitor climate trends across counties, sub-counties, and wards.
* Track pollution levels and emerging environmental threats.
* Receive location-specific actionable insights for immediate intervention.
* Support long-term climate adaptation and environmental resilience strategies.
